A Python implementation of a backtracking algorithm to solve 9√ó9 Sudoku puzzles.

## Example

## Features

- Solves standard 9√ó9 Sudoku puzzles
- Uses recursive backtracking algorithm
- Clear visualization of the solving process
- Handles both solvable and unsolvable puzzles
- Easy-to-use interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sudoku-solver-python.git
cd sudoku-solver-python
```
2.Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed

## Usage

**Define your puzzle (0 represents empty cells)**

```bash
puzzle = [
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0],
    [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8],
    [0, 0, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
]
```
## How It Works

The solver uses a backtracking algorithm which:

Finds the next empty cell

Tries numbers 1-9 in the cell

Checks if the number is valid (no conflicts in row, column, or 3√ó3 box)

Recursively attempts to solve the rest of the board

Backtracks if a solution path fails

## Requirements

**Python 3.7 or higher**
No external dependencies
